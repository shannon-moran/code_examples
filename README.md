# Welcome! Here are some code snippets that I hope will convince you to hire me.

**Languages**: I work in **Python** in my day job as an academic for data analysis, which are demonstrated here. I am also proficient in **SQL** and **bash scripting**, and can work with **C++** code as required. I'm eager to learn other languages.

I've enclosed the following **Python** files. There are two sets available, depending on what you are looking to verify about my coding ability.

Examples of ETL of business data:
* These were written as part of a 3-day take-home exam and represent time-constrained work.
* `take-home/data_processing.py` and `/data_cleaning.py`: These files use `pandas` to clean raw data on listings, hosts, and users (e.g. de-dupe, transform date-time columns, sense-check numerical data). During the processing phase, these files merge relevant tables for easy analysis.
* `take-home/Data-analysis.ipynb`: Python notebook that uses the above python modules to derive business insights from analysis. This represents a subset of my findings during this take-home exam, which were summarized in a 10-page deck.

Examples of more advanced Python for analysis of physics data:
* `simulations/classes.py`: The Python classes here allow me to (1) query a MongoDB NoSQL database and load matching simulation trajectory files, (2) normalize the data as needed, then (3) run spacial/clustering analyses and save the results as class variables. This data pipeline works in tandem with `parallelize.py` below to allow fast, reproducible analysis.
* `simulations/parallelize.py`: My academic research involves analyzing multiple time-series-based data files in aggregate. This class is a `multiprocessing` framework that enables me to run analysis in parallel with just two lines of code, leading to speed-ups of 20x.

I also have two class projects from grad school are well-contained, if you're looking for more examples of how I organize a coding project. Both links below are to Python notebooks with final analyses.
* [Computational physics project modeling and analyzing explosive percolation on a graph network](https://github.com/shannon-moran/computational-physics-F17/blob/master/03_Project/MORAN_SUBMISSION/CODE/Moran_FinalProject.ipynb)
* [Modeling and analysis of explosive percolation on graph networks, given local rules](https://github.com/shannon-moran/fractals-and-percolation-2018/blob/master/02_FINAL_SUBMISSION/FINAL-Project_report_figures.ipynb)
